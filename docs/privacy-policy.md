# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: February 7, 2026*

FocusCage ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how FocusCage handles your information.

## Information We Collect

**FocusCage does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.** All data stays on your device.

The app stores the following information locally on your device only:

- Focus profile configurations (names, schedules, blocked app selections)
- Focus session history and statistics
- App preferences and theme settings

## Screen Time & Family Controls

FocusCage uses Apple's Screen Time API (Family Controls framework) to block apps during your scheduled focus sessions. This access is:

- Initiated entirely by you — the app only blocks apps you choose
- Processed locally on your device by Apple's frameworks
- Not used to monitor, track, or report your app usage to anyone
- Not used for parental controls or monitoring other users

FocusCage does not have access to the names or identifiers of your installed apps. Apple's Family Controls framework uses opaque tokens that do not reveal specific app information to us.

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or transmit any of your data to third parties. FocusCage contains:

- No analytics or tracking SDKs
- No advertising
- No third-party services
- No server-side components

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally on your device using iOS standard storage mechanisms (UserDefaults and App Group shared containers). Data is shared only between the main app and its on-device extensions (widget, device activity monitor) via a secure App Group container.

## Data Deletion

Deleting FocusCage from your device permanently removes all associated data. You can also reset your data by removing and reinstalling the app.

## Children's Privacy

FocusCage is a self-directed productivity app designed for individual use. It is not designed as a parental control tool and does not knowingly collect information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
