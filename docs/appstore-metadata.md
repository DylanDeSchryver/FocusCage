> Take back your screen time. FocusCage blocks distracting apps on a schedule with zero bypasses — because willpower alone isn't enough.

## Description

FocusCage is a strict focus app that blocks distracting apps during your scheduled focus sessions — with zero bypass options.

Unlike other screen time apps that offer "just 5 more minutes" loopholes, FocusCage enforces your boundaries. When your focus session starts, blocked apps stay blocked. No exceptions.

**HOW IT WORKS**

1. Create a Focus Profile with a name, schedule, and the apps you want to block
2. Set your strictness level — Standard, Strict, or Locked
3. FocusCage automatically activates at your scheduled time and blocks your selected apps
4. When your session ends, everything unlocks automatically

**KEY FEATURES**

• Schedule-Based Focus Sessions — Set start/end times and active days for each profile
• App & Category Blocking — Block specific apps or entire categories like Social Media or Games
• Three Strictness Levels — Standard (freely disable), Strict (cooldown + limited unlocks), or Locked (zero bypass until session ends)
• Multiple Profiles — Create different profiles for work, study, sleep, or anything else
• Statistics Dashboard — Track your focus hours, streaks, completion rate, and session history
• Home Screen & Lock Screen Widgets — See your active session timer at a glance
• Live Activities & Dynamic Island — Real-time session countdown right from your Lock Screen
• Beautiful Themes — Choose from five color themes: Indigo, Ocean, Emerald, Sunset, and Rose
• 100% Private — All data stays on your device. No accounts, no analytics, no tracking.

**STRICTNESS LEVELS**

• Standard — Disable blocking freely at any time. Great for getting started.
• Strict — 10-minute cooldown and a maximum of 2 unlocks per session. For when you need accountability.
• Locked — Cannot be disabled during scheduled time. Period. For when you're serious.

**PRIVACY FIRST**

FocusCage contains no ads, no analytics, no tracking, and no server-side components. Your data never leaves your device.

## App Review Notes

**IMPORTANT — Please read before reviewing:**

FocusCage uses Apple's Family Controls / Screen Time API (FamilyControls, ManagedSettings, DeviceActivity frameworks) for its core functionality. The approved Family Controls entitlement is associated with this app's bundle ID.

**What this app does:**
- FocusCage is a SELF-DIRECTED focus/productivity app — it is NOT a parental control or MDM tool
- The user voluntarily creates focus profiles, selects which apps to block, and chooses their own schedule
- No remote management, no monitoring of other users, no data collection

**To test the app:**
1. Open the app and complete the onboarding flow
2. Grant Screen Time access when prompted
3. Create a new profile: tap "Profiles" → "+" → enter a name → select apps to block → set a schedule that includes the current time → choose a strictness level → save
4. The profile will automatically activate during the scheduled time, blocking selected apps
5. Check the "Stats" tab to see session history
6. Add the widget from the Home Screen for at-a-glance status

**Note:** This app requires a physical iOS device for testing. The Screen Time API does not function in the iOS Simulator.
