    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Last updated: February 7, 2026</p>

    <p>FocusCage ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how FocusCage handles your information.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>FocusCage does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.</strong> All data stays on your device.</p>
    <p>The app stores the following information locally on your device only:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Focus profile configurations (names, schedules, blocked app selections)</li>
        <li>Focus session history and statistics</li>
        <li>App preferences and theme settings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Screen Time &amp; Family Controls</h2>
    <p>FocusCage uses Apple's Screen Time API (Family Controls framework) to block apps during your scheduled focus sessions. This access is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Initiated entirely by you — the app only blocks apps you choose</li>
        <li>Processed locally on your device by Apple's frameworks</li>
        <li>Not used to monitor, track, or report your app usage to anyone</li>
        <li>Not used for parental controls or monitoring other users</li>
    </ul>
    <p>FocusCage does not have access to the names or identifiers of your installed apps. Apple's Family Controls framework uses opaque tokens that do not reveal specific app information to us.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, or transmit any of your data to third parties. FocusCage contains:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No analytics or tracking SDKs</li>
        <li>No advertising</li>
        <li>No third-party services</li>
        <li>No server-side components</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All data is stored locally on your device using iOS standard storage mechanisms (UserDefaults and App Group shared containers). Data is shared only between the main app and its on-device extensions (widget, device activity monitor) via a secure App Group container.</p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>Deleting FocusCage from your device permanently removes all associated data. You can also reset your data by removing and reinstalling the app.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>FocusCage is a self-directed productivity app designed for individual use. It is not designed as a parental control tool and does not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.</p>
