# Terms of Service

*Last updated: February 7, 2026*

By downloading or using FocusCage ("the app"), you agree to the following terms. Please read them carefully.

## 1. Description of Service

FocusCage is a self-directed focus and productivity app for iOS. It uses Apple's Screen Time API to block access to apps and app categories during user-configured focus sessions. The app is designed for individual use and is not a parental control or device management tool.

## 2. Acceptance of Terms

By using FocusCage, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the app.

## 3. Screen Time & App Blocking

FocusCage uses Apple's Family Controls, ManagedSettings, and DeviceActivity frameworks to enforce app blocking during scheduled focus sessions. By granting Screen Time access, you acknowledge that:

- Blocked apps will be inaccessible during active focus sessions
- Certain strictness levels ("Strict" and "Locked") intentionally limit your ability to disable blocking early
- The "Locked" strictness level cannot be overridden until the scheduled end time
- You are solely responsible for configuring schedules and strictness levels appropriate for your needs

## 4. User Responsibility

You are responsible for:

- Ensuring your focus schedules do not interfere with emergency communications
- Understanding the implications of each strictness level before enabling it
- Configuring profiles that are appropriate for your situation

**Important:** The Phone and Emergency SOS apps are never blocked by FocusCage. Apple's frameworks ensure critical system functions remain accessible at all times.

## 5. Limitation of Liability

FocusCage is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, express or implied. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to:

- Loss of access to apps during focus sessions
- Missed notifications or communications while blocking is active
- Any inconvenience resulting from the intended function of the app

## 6. Intellectual Property

All content, design, and code within FocusCage are the intellectual property of the developer. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or reverse-engineer any part of the app.

## 7. Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. Please refer to our [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md) for information on how we handle your data.

## 8. Termination

You may stop using FocusCage at any time by deleting the app from your device. All locally stored data will be permanently removed upon deletion.

## 9. Changes to Terms

We reserve the right to modify these Terms of Service at any time. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.

## 10. Governing Law

These terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable law, without regard to conflict of law principles.
