    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Why does FocusCage need Screen Time access?</h3>
        <p>FocusCage uses Apple's Screen Time API to block distracting apps during your focus sessions. This is the only way iOS allows apps to restrict access to other apps. Without this permission, the app cannot enforce blocking.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>I accidentally set a profile to "Locked" and can't disable it. What do I do?</h3>
        <p>The "Locked" strictness level is designed to prevent disabling until the scheduled end time. This is intentional — it's for users who want maximum accountability. Wait for the session to end, then change the strictness level to "Standard" or "Strict" if you prefer more flexibility.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I still make phone calls during a focus session?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Apple's frameworks ensure the Phone app, Emergency SOS, and other critical system functions are never blocked, regardless of your blocking settings.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>My apps aren't being blocked even though a session is active.</h3>
        <p>Try these steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Open Settings &rarr; Screen Time and make sure Screen Time is enabled</li>
            <li>Open FocusCage &rarr; Settings and check that Screen Time access shows "Authorized"</li>
            <li>Make sure you've selected specific apps or categories to block in your profile</li>
            <li>Verify the current day is included in your profile's active days</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How do I delete my data?</h3>
        <p>All data is stored locally on your device. Deleting the FocusCage app will permanently remove all profiles, session history, and preferences.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Does FocusCage work without an internet connection?</h3>
        <p>Yes. FocusCage works entirely offline. It does not require an internet connection for any of its features.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Why doesn't the widget update immediately?</h3>
        <p>iOS controls how often widgets refresh. The FocusCage widget updates when a focus session starts or ends, and periodically during active sessions. There may be a brief delay due to iOS widget refresh policies.</p>
